## instructions:

install the dependencies with the command :

```bash
$ npm install 
```

at the root of the folder run the command : 

```bash
$ npm start 
```

The server is now running and to check the results I recommend the app EXPO in iOS or android, then scan the QR code given by the server (previous instruction).
